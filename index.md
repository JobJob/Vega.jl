title: Vega.jl - A Julia package for generating visualizations in Vega

---

# Overview

The Vega package provides a Julia wrapper around the [Vega Visualization Grammar](http://trifacta.github.io/vega/) from [Trifacta](http://www.trifacta.com/).

In particular, Vega.jl provides:

* A series of Julia composite types representing Vega primitives
* An intermediate-grammar in Julia for quickly creating default settings for scales, axes, legends, etc.
* High-level functions for creating visualizations such as bar charts, area charts, line charts and so on.
